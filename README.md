How to test:
============
Download the latest zip file from the following link: https://github.com/SofaDefrost/Sofa.Component/releases
Then unzip the content of the directory into the site-packages/Sofa 

On a system with
```console
   SOFA_ROOT=/home/username/sofa/
   PYTHONPATH=/home/username/sofa/lib/python3/site-packages
```
The unzipping should be extracted into 
```console
/home/username/sofa/lib/python3/site-packages/Sofa
```
So that, the files with extension .pyi are side by side the .py. with similar name.
